**Research Focus**

Music is an integral part of everyday life and has the ability to evoke strong emotional responses, even when listeners do not understand the language of a song. While lyrics convey semantic meaning that may influence emotional interpretation, listeners often report similar emotional experiences when hearing cover versions in unfamiliar languages, suggesting that melody, rhythm, and vocal expression may play a more dominant role than lyrical comprehension.

This raises an important question about what truly shapes emotional responses to music: the meaning of the lyrics or the musical features themselves?

**Songs Analyzed**

- Solo - Clean Bandit (Original)
- Solo (Spanish Cover)
- Lost on You - LP (Original)
- Lost on You (Spanish Cover)
- Issues - Julia Michaels (Original)
- Issues (French Cover)

---

**Key Measures**

- Emotional Intensity (1-7)
- Valence (1-6)
- Familiarity (1-7)
- Lyric Comprehension (1-5)

**Research Question**

*To what extent do lyrics, compared to melody, influence emotional responses to music?*

---

**Hypothesis Test**

We use regression analysis to test whether lyric comprehension predicts emotional response:

- **If lyrics dominate**: Higher comprehension → stronger/more positive emotional response (significant positive slope)
- **If melody dominates**: Comprehension has little effect (flat slope, non-significant p-value)

---

**Statistical Measures**

- **R²**: Variance explained by comprehension
- **p-value**: Statistical significance of the relationship
- **Regression line**: Direction and strength of effect

## Column 1 {width=50%}

### Comprehension → Emotional Intensity

### Study Overview

This study examines whether understanding song lyrics affects emotional responses to music. We collected data from 39 participants who listened to 6 songs (3 originals and 3 cover versions in different languages).

**Methodology**

Participants rated each song on:

- **Emotional Intensity** (1-7 scale): How strongly the music affected them
- **Valence** (1-6 scale): How positive/negative the emotional response was
- **Lyric Comprehension** (1-5 scale): How well they understood the lyrics

We then performed linear regression to determine if comprehension predicts emotional response.

### Interpreting the Results

A **significant positive slope** (p < 0.05) would indicate that understanding lyrics enhances emotional response, supporting the "lyrics matter" hypothesis.

A **non-significant relationship** (p ≥ 0.05) would suggest that melody, rhythm, and vocal expression dominate emotional response regardless of lyric comprehension.

The **R² value** indicates what proportion of variance in emotional response is explained by comprehension level.
